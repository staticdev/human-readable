## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.9+ and the following tools:

- [Hatch]

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ hatch env create
```

You can now run an interactive Python session:

```console
$ hatch shell
import human_readable
```

[hatch]: https://hatch.pypa.io/

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ hatch run all
```

List the available Hatch env scripts:

```console
$ hatch env show
```

You can run a specific Hatch env script.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ hatch run tests:run
```

Unit tests are located in the `tests` directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to add a new locale

Make sure you have installed a PO Editor, you can easily install that on a Debian-based system with:

```console
apt install poedit
```

To add a new locale you need to execute:

```console
xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 -o human_readable.pot -k'_' -k'N_' -k'P_:1c,2' -l python src/human_readable/*.py  # extract new phrases
msginit -i human_readable.pot -o human_readable/locale/<locale name>/LC_MESSAGES/human_readable.po --locale <locale name>
```

Then edit your .po file in the locale folder that got created.

If possible, add tests to `tests/functional/new_locale`. Run them with:

```console
nox -s tests
```

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before commiting your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
